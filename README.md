# FEM---Calculator-App
A Frontend Mentor Challenge to build a calculator app.
This task challenged my JS skills and made me recondiser changing career path ðŸ˜­. But we made it :). You f*ck up when you give up. 
Also used CSS grids to style the page. I think I might have a good grasp of CSS grid now.
